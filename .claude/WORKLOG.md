# Worklog

Updated: 2026-10-29 23:15

## Current focus

- **Topic:** After the T3 v0.1.5 sync: per-chat Brain on "No project" chats, lint debt
- **Goal:** Every fork feature works on T3 v0.1.5 and the fork passes T3's lint and knip checks
- **Branch:** develop (next: feat/no-project-brain, chore/t3-lint-rules)
- **Last step done:** sync/t3-v0.1.5 merged into develop; server smoke run with Brain ready
- **Next step:** Port per-chat Brain (d18ed904d, c91d5ae57) onto T3's No project chats
- **Open questions / blockers:** Codex and OpenCode curator flags unverified (CLIs not
  installed here); owner to try a real chat in the Dev Flow
