# Worklog

Updated: 2026-10-30 00:10

## Current focus

- **Topic:** The Brain as a closable tab of T3's right panel (option A)
- **Goal:** Brain tab open by default per chat, remembered when closed, header button with
  update dot, nothing shown for a chat without a Brain
- **Branch:** feat/brain-right-panel (worktree .t3/worktrees/brain-panel)
- **Last step done:** Brain surface, default-open per chat, header button, new-tab menu and
  command palette entries, readChat lists the chat's own Brain; store tests pass
- **Next step:** Owner tries it in the Dev Flow (new chat, close tab, reload, No Brain chat),
  then merge into develop with --no-ff
- **Open questions / blockers:** Server change (readChat state) not covered by a server test;
  server tests are off limits inside the live service
